Data standardization is a key part of ensuring data quality. Lacking standardization results in bad data,
which has numerous negative effects, from sending bad emails, to mailing to bad addresses, to losing customers altogether.

Unfortunately, data standardization is often left out of discussions when planning the input and organization of your company data, especially when you’re implementing a CRM system. 

** Step 1: Understanding and Cleaning Your Data ** 

There are a number of different ways to approach standardization, but it comes down to being proactive toward the data that’s going into your CRM system. You want to make sure that the data is correct, clean, complete, formatted and verified before it gets committed into your CRM system, and before you take action on that data. Doing so ensures the accuracy and integrity of the information; and it’s going to prevent that dirty data from entering your database. It helps ensure that your operational efficiency is at its highest level by cleaning that data either prior to migrations and campaigns or, at that initial point of entry within your CRM system. Data cleanse technologies, like RingLead DMS Cleanse, will clean out all duplicates inside your CRM or Marketing Automation System and standardize the data automatically as it matches and merges records.
